# Android-Sensor-Data-Collector
v 0.1 beta

This is a simple, one-click Android application to continuously collect sensor data from the device in-built sensors like the GPS coordinates, Gyroscope & accelerometer data. All the collected data will be stored in a CSV file, which can later be used as a data source to train ML models, create systems that compute motion data to generate insights etc.
